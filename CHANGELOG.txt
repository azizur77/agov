aGov Changelog

7.x-2.0-dev
===========
Features
- aGov's base theme is now based on Zen, rather than Omega. Existing Omega themes
  will still work, but may have a naming conflict.
- TinyMCE has been replaced with CKEditor
- Global Redirect has been added
- LinkIt has been added

Updates
- Google Analytics is updated to 2.x
- Drupal core up to date

7.x-1.0
=======
Features
- All aGov components are now in a new module ('agov_components') which is
  held separately on Drupal.org. This effectively enables proper security
  updates for aGov. If you are updating from an earlier release, you should
  enable this module.
- A new module, aGov Password Policy, provides new password complexity rules
  compatible with ISM April 2014
- The "Manage Display" tab is now generally hidden
- The Redirect 403 to User Login module has been added
- Global Redirect has been added and is enabled on new installs
- Updates to Password Policy, Chosen, Context, Date, Display Suite, Entity API, File Entity,
  Google Analytics, Honeypot and Libraries
- Drupal has been updated to 7.30

Fixes
- The Contact Page was sometimes not visible to anonymous users
- TinyMCE packaging is broken on Drupal.org, the make file uses a different source
  till this is rectified. This should have no practical impact.

Other notes
- aGov is now tested automatically using Travis, PHPCS, Behat and other testing
  tools
